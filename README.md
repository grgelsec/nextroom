## GOAL ✅

The point of this project is to expose me to Next.js and try my best to exhaust the extent of its capabilities in able to expose myself to as much as I can so that I can begin to learn the framework very well. With that, when browsing the code you may notice notes about Next.js features that may seem basic but those are there because that is when I learned about/used a Next.js feature or coding concept that I was encountering for the first time.

## Current Plan 🌎

- Stick with the current design I have in figma.
- Implement these features in order
  - Map popups containing available times.
  - Full availbility view page with all rooms and their availabilities.

## 3/26

- Figure out how to make the popups look how you want them to
- Display the room number, availability, and the next available time in the room pop up
- When I click on a room card then it activates a pop up.
- Add a book now link to the top of the side bar

## 3/27

- Create the view all page that has all of the rooms and availability with the info at the top and a book now link.

## 3/28

- Finish the landing hero bar
- Make the side bar be a modal for moble viewers - might take a minute haha

## Current Bugs 🐛

- Rooms that dont have a time are showing nothing - low prio
