## GOAL ✅

The point of this project is to expose me to Next.js and try my best to exhaust the extent of its capabilities in able to expose myself to as much as I can so that I can begin to learn the framework very well. With that, when browsing the code you may notice notes about Next.js features that may seem basic but those are there because that is when I learned about/used a Next.js feature or coding concept that I was encountering for the first time.

## Current Plan 🌎

- Stick with the current design I have in figma.
- Implement these features in order
  - Sidebar room availability
  - Map popups containing available times.
  - Full availbility view page with all rooms and their availabilities.

## TODO for current feature - Sidebar room availbility 📋

- Fix the API so that it returns the next 3-4 available times.

- Add a key for red being available and red unavailable.

## Current Bugs 🐛

- Available endpoint is returning "Unavailable/Padding" just need "Unavailable"
