## GOAL ✅

The point of this project is to expose me to Next.js and try my best to exhaust the extent of its capabilities in able to expose myself to as much as I can so that I can begin to learn the framework very well.

## Current Plan 🌎

- Stick with the current design I have in figma.
- Implement these features in order
  - Sidebar room availability
  - Map popups containing available times.
  - Full availbility view page with all rooms and their availabilities.

## TODO for current feature - Sidebar room availbility 📋

- Fix Unavailable/Padding API return
- Fix the API so that it returns the next 3-4 available times.
- Make the red and green glowing dots
- Make the dots red until the next available time. If the current time is available then show green dots.
- Add a key for red being available and red unavailable.

## Current Bugs 🐛

- Available endpoint is returning "Unavailable/Padding" just need "Unavailable"
