## GOAL âœ…

The point of this project is to expose me to Next.js and try my best to exhaust the extent of its capabilities in able to expose myself to as much as I can so that I can begin to learn the framework very well. With that, when browsing the code you may notice notes about Next.js features that may seem basic but those are there because that is when I learned about/used a Next.js feature or coding concept that I was encountering for the first time.

## Current Plan ðŸŒŽ

- Stick with the current design I have in figma.
- Implement these features in order
  - Hosting in a container/aws

## TODO

- Finish landing for the sidebar
- Host
