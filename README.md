## GOAL ✅

The point of this project is to expose me to Next.js and try my best to exhaust the extent of its capabilities in able to expose myself to as much as I can so that I can begin to learn the framework very well. With that, when browsing the code you may notice notes about Next.js features that may seem basic but those are there because that is when I learned about/used a Next.js feature or coding concept that I was encountering for the first time.

## Current Plan 🌎

- Stick with the current design I have in figma.
- Implement these features in order
  - Map popups containing available times.
  - Full availbility view page with all rooms and their availabilities.

## TODO for current feature - Sidebar room availbility 📋

- Touch up Side Bar availability and make it look better and fix the html/w/h (make it responsive)
  -fix the layout and make the button on the bottom less ugly, fix the bg and make the button just overlay
- Add a key for red being available and red unavailable.

## Current Bugs 🐛

- Rooms that dont have a time are showing nothing - low prio
